# Learn Series by Kresna Website

Learn series website by Kresna Satya. This website created with [Astro Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build). The purpose of this website is a digital notes of what I have learned. The notes can be a how-to do something, micro tips, and curated reference.

Imagine, you have learn something, do something that maybe difficult, a lot of steps to do, and repetitive.Then, after couple of weeks or months you're back then do it but unfortunately you forgot because you didn't document it.

> Sounds familiar, huh!?

Maybe software like Notion or Obsidian may help, but I think 80% of us use that software as a private notes instead of public notes want to do it in another way. I want to treat it as a public digital notes that can be access by anyone on internet.

## How to run?

> I'm using pnpm because it offers symlinked node_modules structure and it makes storage disk in my laptop lean.

1. Git clone
2. Use `pnpm install` and `pnpm run dev`.
