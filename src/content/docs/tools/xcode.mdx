I can't believe that I can use Xcode for programming Swift and SwiftUI with MacBook Air M1 with 256GB storage and 8GB of RAM. I can't believe that this machine is strong enough to do that! Thanks Apple Silicon.

## Error: No Signing certificate “Mac Development” found

There's a case when you run a code sample from third party and you get error message below. Here's the example.

> No signing certificate "Mac Development" found: No "Mac Development" signing certificate matching team ID "A93A5CM278" with a private key was found. 
(in target 'Keyword Bubble' from project 'KeywordBubble')

### How to solve it?

1. Open your project in Xcode
2. On the project navigator, click project name to show **Project and Targets.**
3. Focus on **Targets** section.
4. In **Targets > Build Settings > Signing**
    1. Change value of **Code Signing Identity** to **Sign to run locally**
    2. Change value of **Code Signing Style** to **Manual**
    3. Change value of **Development Team** to **Personal** or **None**
5. Try again and see if works!
