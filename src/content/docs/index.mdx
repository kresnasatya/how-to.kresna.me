Learn series website by Kresna Satya. This website created with [Astro Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build). The purpose of this website is a digital notes of what I have learned. The notes can be a how-to do something, micro tips, and curated reference.

Imagine, you have learn something, do something that maybe difficult, a lot of steps to do, and repetitive.
Couple of weeks or months later, you're back then do it again. But, you forgot it because you didn't document it.

> Sounds familiar, huh!?

Maybe software like Notion or Obsidian may help you to document what have you done, I use it too but as a private notes.
Although they are provide an option to share your notes public, sometimes you may want to try a different way.
Example: I familiar with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Markdown. I want to collect my notes from Notion or Obsdian into a website. I can modify this site with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and markdown.

Those are the reasons why this site comes up. I treat this site as a public digital notes of what I have learn, collect, and curated.
I believe that this site is a place to help myself in the future or you if you forget about how-to do something and seeking references.
