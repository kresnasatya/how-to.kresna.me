How-to series website by Kresna Satya. This website created with Astro Starlight. The purpose of this website is a note to my self or maybe anyone when how-to do something step by step. Imagine, you have do something that's difficult, a lot of steps to do, and you do it repetitive. Then, after couple of weeks or months you're back then do it again then you forgot how-to do that!?

> Sounds familiar, huh!?

Maybe software like Notion or Obsidian may help, but I think 80% of us use that software as a private notes instead of public notes want to do it in another way. I want to treat it as a digital notes that can be access by anyone on internet.

I think about how to make it profit. Hmm...
