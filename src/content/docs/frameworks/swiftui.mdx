SwiftUI is a Swift framework to create a User Interface for app in Apple products. It was released on 2019 at WWDC2019. When [I watch the announcement of SwiftUI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psL_5RIBqnY&t=7675s), [my mind was blown away!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psL_5RIBqnY&t=7712s) I cannot believe that you can shipped less code to build User Interface for mobile app. In the past, I build Android App with Java programming + XML on Android Studio. Now, Kotlin replace Java as a recommended programming language to build Android App so you can write less code to build User Interface for Android App. But, if I compare Kotlin with SwiftUI by syntax, SwiftUI is a winner because of less code. Here's comparison between SwiftUI and Kotlin when create a screen "Hello, World".

I can say that SwiftUI is better than Kotlin. Maybe sounds trivial or weird for you but for me if I want to see the programming language is good or bad, I will see by the syntax definition at first. I think I don't want to back to programming Kotlin for Android app for a distant moment. I'm using MacBook Air M1 with 256GB storage and 8GB of RAM for programming with Swift and SwiftUI in Xcode. I can't believe that this machine is strong enough to do that! Thanks Apple Silicon.

## Pathway

I have tell you that I have been programming Swift with Swift Playgrounds in [Swift Programming section](/programming/swift). The experience is great! Now, I'm seeking a guideline or tutorial to build app with Swift and SwiftUI. Fortunately I found it from Apple Developer Documentation site. Here are the list of guide to start learning Swift and SwiftUI (follow the order).

> Repeat, repeat, and repeat again until you understand!

### Develop in Swift

This is the first stop to start learning Swift and SwiftUI. When I first time visit this site, it feels like I'm in a vast forest. A lot of informations appears and blown my head! A lot of things to try and try again to understand how it works. It's a great journey! No, no! I don't mean this site is bad! Instead this site is really-really well! It gives me step-by-step how to do that with clear explanation with code snippet, image, and preview.

__Site__: [Develop in Swift | Apple Developer Documentation](https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/develop-in-swift)

### SwiftUI Tutorials

This is the next site to pick after you try **Develop in Swift**. This site will give you a comprehensive tutorial how to code with SwiftUI by create a project called "Landmarks". You will learn SwiftUI Essentials, Drawing and animation, App Design and layout, Framework integration.

__Site__: [SwiftUI Tutorials | Apple Developer Documentation](https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/swiftui)

### SwiftUI Concepts

After you try **Introducing SwiftUI**, you must visit and read the SwiftUI Concepts. It covers structure of a Swift app project, how to layout, and how to state and data flow. It also gives you a code sample to try in your Xcode. But, becareful you may not be able to run the code sample on Xcode because of different Team. The error will be _Error: No Signing certificate “Mac Development” found_. Fortunately, I write a guide how to solve this problem in [Xcode tools section](/tools/xcode).

__Site:__ [SwiftUI Concepts | Apple Developer Documentation](https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/swiftui-concepts)

### Sample Apps Tutorials

This site covers sample apps build with Swift and SwiftUI from navigating apps, presenting content, retrieving content from a server, responding to user input, capturing and displaying photos, and get started with machine learning.

## Padding in SwiftUI

The `.padding` modifier creates a new padded view with empty space around it, which is affected by any modifiers coming after it. If you want the padded area to have background color, you must modify that padded view.

```swift
// ContentView.swift
// ChatPrototype

import SwiftUI

struct ContentView: View {
		var body: some View {
				VStack {
						Text("Hello")
								.background(Color.yellow)
								.padding()
						Text("Hello")
								.padding()
								.background(Color.yellow)
				}
				.padding()
		}
}
```
